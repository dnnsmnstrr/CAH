Currently, the focus of this app is the watch companion, so don't pay too much attention to the actual app, which at the moment can be used to provide black cards for a real-life game, althoug it already includes all existing extension decks.
On Apple Watch, you can play a modified mini-version of the game with short rounds in a local multiplayer setting. Enjoy!
